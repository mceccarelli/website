### Survey Article from the literature

 - Link for future reference

 https://www.iacr.org/archive/crypto2005/36210017/36210017.pdf

 - Citation of the article

 Wang, Xiaoyun, Yiqun Lisa Yin, and Hongbo Yu. "Finding collisions in the full SHA-1." Annual international cryptology conference. Springer, Berlin, Heidelberg, 2005.

 - In two or three sentences, discuss the goals of this article.

 This article was awesome!!!!!  This is exactly what I've been looking for throughout my searches for hashing algorithms, and this one finally explores an actual collision on SHA-1!  In my previous presentations, I've discussed the fact that some of the hashing algorithms under the SHA family are now considered "historic" (broken and thus their lifespan is over), but this article is actually why.

 - What is /are the general task(s) that all the methods address in the article?

 The article is tasked with presenting a collision for SHA-1, showing that the hashing algorithm should be considered outdated and obsolete.  

 - What are some of the leading methods introduced and discussed in this paper?

 The idea was to show, from an analysis perspective, exactly why SHA-1 is broken.  There are some advanced mathematical topics in this article, and it was quite hard to parse (I still have ways to go), but it's so amazing to read about.

 - What is the context of the discussion of these methods? For instance, are there demonstrations in light of some task that they address?

 The mathematics is laid out so that it is clear why the hashing algorithm faces a "collision" in this sense, and why SHA-1 needed to be strengthened in order to stay relevant.  The whole idea of a hashing algorithm is that the original, encrypted message is kept secret forever, and that there is no inverse function to perform on the output of the hashing algorithm to find that original message.  This paper shows that that fundamental concept is in jeopardy, and it was awesome to see why that is.

 - How can some of these methods be used in your own work? What purpose would the method serve in your work?

 Well, the reason I've been searching for a paper like this is because the topic is exactly what I want to study with regards to hashing algorithms.  I really want a deep understanding of the ideas and concepts that are required to create hashing algorithms, and part of that is knowing how and why they can be broken.  This isn't an article I'd recommend someone start with that's just getting into hashing algorithms, but for someone looking for more advanced details, this is exactly where to look.

### First article from the literature

 - Link for future reference

 https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Neha-Kishore/publication/307415004_Attacks_on_and_Advances_in_Secure_Hash_Algorithms/links/57da45e508ae5f03b49a2000/Attacks-on-and-Advances-in-Secure-Hash-Algorithms.pdf

 - Citation of the article

 Kishore, Neha, and Bhanu Kapoor. "Attacks on and advances in secure hash algorithms." IAENG Int. J. Comput. Sci 43.3 (2016): 326-335.

 - What is the goal of this article?

 The article describes lots of different things, and is a really strong summarization of hashing algorithms.  There is certainly a specific focus on the SHA family of algorithms, and the background, integrity, weaknesses, and improvements are all discussed.  I really like this article because its a good intermediate step for me in my journey through hashing algorithms, a great resource to learn from and look back on.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 The main goal of the article is to do as described above.  It begins with what's more of an overview than anything, rather than diving right into technical details.  SHA steals the show, with all variants being considered, and the hashing algorithm is discussed in depth on what "collisions" it resists and which ones break it.  The weaknesses of the hashing algorithms are most fascinating to me, as I am really interested in breaking down the mathematics and semantics of how attacks work and why they do.  The article also left me with a bunch of questions as well, which I hope to explore some more later, both from a mathematical side and from a computer science side.

### Second article from the literature

 - Link for future reference

 https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/ett.4460050406

 - Citation of the article

 Preneel, Bart. "Cryptographic hash functions." European Transactions on Telecommunications 5.4 (1994): 431-448.

 - What is the goal of this article?

 This article also gives introduction to cryptography, while giving an excellent explanation as to how these types of functions work, and where their strengths and weaknesses lie.  It is yet another perfect example for me to start in hashing algorithms.

 - In about 100 words, please summarize the main goal of the article.

 The goal of the article is to give an overview of cryptography, and eventually touch on hashing algorithms.  The fundamentals are discussed, as well as some of the details that make cryptography work in the real world.  I really enjoyed this article because it was more of what I was looking for, I enjoyed the details that the author discusses about how the ideas come together. In other words, the article was a bit more technical than some of the ones I've been looking at.  There's also some emphasis on mathematics, and outside of class, I've been looking for books that I can use to expand my knowledge of hashing algorithms and the mathematics that is behind them.
