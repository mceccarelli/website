### Autobiography

Hi! I’m Michael, a student of mathematics and computer science at Allegheny College.  I enjoy learning about cryptography, my favorite link between the two.  I have experience with the mathematical concepts needed to understand modern cryptography, and have been researching ECC, RSA, and hashing algorithms.

### Introduction

I always found mathematics to be beautiful, and when I got to Allegheny I had a lot of opportunities to explore the subject further.  I still have quite a long way to go, but have developed a soft spot for number theory and cryptography.  In the CS Seminar, I started digging into the computer science side of things way more, and discovered all kinds of applications of the concepts from mathematics, from RSA to hashing algorithms.  There are a lot of problems to exploit that we do not have answers to, specifically a lot of questions in number theory, and there seems to be an application for each one.  I’m super excited to explore all these topics, and it is certainly going to be hard for me to choose a research area for my senior project.

I took a class called “Cryptography” a few years ago, which was focused purely on the mathematical side of things.  However, I absolutely fell in love with it, the concepts that make modern cryptography work are truly brilliant.  For the final project of the class, I wrote a mock RSA program that simulated an insecure channel for Alice and Bob to communicate through, a classic cryptography problem.  Although there is certainly no real world application to my work, it kicked off my love of encryption algorithms and inspired me to learn as much as I can about the world of computer security and number theory.  The connection between the two is absolutely amazing, and one day, I hope to enter the field of cybersecurity.

### Blog Post

At this point in my work, I'm going to try to answer some questions pertaining to the breaking of hashing algorithms. This is going to take quite a bit of work, but studying the already tremendous amount of research on this topic, and trying to model my ideas off of those, is the route I plan on taking.
There are a lot of details to parse through here. I have very small amount of previous experience with hashing algorithms, so the basics have to be mastered first. I want to learn about the different types of algorithms, and their individual family members as well. This will give me insight on what I'm working with when it comes to hashes, and how they actually are created. That's an essential part in my overall goal.
However, once I do gain a solid foundation of the underlying principles associated with the hashing algorithms, I'll then be able to move into some more advanced articles describing collisions on them. I have a feeling I'll be referencing my knowledge of attacks on RSA, the first cryptosystem that I learned.
It's going to be a lot of work, and very challenging at that, but I'm really looking forward to this opportunity. I'm hopeful that this project will motivate me even more into the security field, something I've considered as a career path.
