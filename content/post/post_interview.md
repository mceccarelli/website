### Summary

In order to successfully complete my project, there's going to be quite a bit of work required to get it all done.  My main concern is time, as i don't know how long it will take to learn all the things I need to about hashing algorithms and the various theorems behind them that make everything work, and make everything secure.  There are so many details that one has to absorb to truly have an understanding of what's going on, and I'm not even close to that point yet.  The more I discover, the more questions I take away from the whole thing.  There might have to be cuts made to my ambitions, but I'm still passionate about the project, and I really want to learn more about hashing algorithms and the mathematics behind them.  It's cool too see the intersection of all my previous knowledge come together in one textbook, namely the one I'm reading about cryptography to get started, and even though there's a long road head, I can make significant progress if I time myself appropriately.

Some of the ideas I have are creating a hash identifier, that will take in a hash and try to identify the algorithm that created it.  Another is making a hash cracker, which is definitely a bit more challenging and will require more specific knowledge of collisions that each hashing algorithm is vulnerable to, but is still technically possible if it's scaled back properly.  Finally, and perhaps the most difficult, is creating my own hashing algorithm myself, perhaps another iteration of MD or SHA, but this is certainly a big challenge.  I am not sure if I will have acquired the knowledge and experience in time to complete the last one, but if it gets there, that's awesome.  It'll really show my knowledge of hashing algorithms and the principles that drive them.
