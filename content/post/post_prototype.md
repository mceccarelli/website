### Prototype

I changed up my project topic slightly over the past couple of weeks, at this point in time, breaking hash functions seems infeasible for a senior project, so I am going to make a tool that teaches people about hashing algorithms.  It'll take input, and hash it, but instead of giving the final output it will show the steps.

The prototype that I built is certainly a work in progress, but it is a good start for me.  I have designed a couple of the algorithms that I will need, just from what I've read are useful through various books I'm using to study hashing functions.  There's still a super long way to go, but in the end I hope to accept input from either an input file or the terminal window.  Right now the terminal window is working properly, and I'm in the middle of being able to accept text files, which will be done shortly.

My next goal is to start learning about bit-shifting, an essential part of hash functions.  I haven't taken the computer organization course, which I'll be doing in the Fall, so I will need to learn about some of the topics covered there on my own.  I also need to buy a few of the books I've been borrowing, they're great learning tools, and the only things that have been able to push me in the right direction.  I'll be using their examples as a model when I try to implement my own hash function.
